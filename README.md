AHOY! Simple TBP Proxy for your loot.

Ziggo en XS4ALL, Dutch ISPs are forced to [deny access to the
piratebay](http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/oc7np/nl_dutch_court_orders_blocking_of_pirate_bay/).

This is crap.

Therefore, if we install simple proxies on servers that can still acces
TPB, banning will not be possible; unless "They" start to ban
every site that has a proxy, now and in future.

# Requirements
A webserver with PHP5.x and PHP's curl.

# TODOs
Somehow the search-result pages are empty. Gotta find out why their
content is zero. And fix that. Looks like something is blocking it on
TPB-side, and returning empty pages to us.

Broadcast this README, so that Google can pick it up: users can then
discover all the installations.

Once searchengines can give a list of installed proxies, we should allow
automatic redirection to these peer-proxies.
